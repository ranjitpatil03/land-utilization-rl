# Multi-Agent Rules + RL Starter

This is a lightweight starter kit that mirrors the 7â€“10 day assignment:
- Agents for fetch/parse/classify/calc
- Simple RL environment and agent stub
- End-to-end orchestration on two sample cases (Mumbai, Pune)
- JSON outputs and a basic OBJ geometry export

## Quickstart
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```

Outputs will appear under `io/outputs/` and `geometry/exports/`.
